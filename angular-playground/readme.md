We've already discussed the index.html file. Let's take a look at the JavaScript files:
 -  main.js: your application code and everything you have imported
 - vendor.js: third-party code that your application depends on
 - polyfills.js: polyfills that allow using newer features in older environments (e.g., using Angular on outdated Web browsers)
 - runtime.js: utility code used by Webpack to load code at runtime
Those JavaScript bundles are generated by Webpack, and added as <script> tags in the index.html file, as we've seen previously.
